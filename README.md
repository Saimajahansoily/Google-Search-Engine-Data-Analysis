# Google-Search-Engine-Data-Analysis

Here is another new Learning of mine is Pytrends. 
Pytrends is an unofficial Python library that allows easy access to Google Trends data through Google’s internal API. Since Google doesn’t provide an official public API for Trends data, Pytrends acts as a smart wrapper around Google's web interface, enabling data analysts and developers to extract trend data for various keywords, regions, and timeframes.
in this project I use Pytrends for the market research and kye word research. It helps me to find the insites from the googlem search engine data.

here are the insites that i need to find after cleaning and visualize the data sets-

Q1- First, write a code where, by changing just the keyword, we can search for multiple things.

Q2-Top 15 countries where the keywords are searched the most, and also create visual representation of it

Q3-A world map needs to be plotted showing the countries that search the keyword the most.

Q4-We need to extract the time-wise interest of the keyword — how it trended in different years.

Q5-Compare related keywords and plot the graph.

There in this jupyter notebook , i porformed all the task that are mentioned.
